# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
For me  I understood better DOM interactions  with Intelli J Idea as it is really easy to see the live changes happen such as like when I clicked the button it updated the counter right away 'live'.
## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I chose my milestone messages by trying to base it as close as to tease the user so that they can keep going. I thought this was funny and would make the user want to keep on clicking. More of a tease rather than a heckle.
## What challenge or bug surprised you?
The bug that surprised me was when I would not use DOMContentLoaded and it would just load a blank page as it was 'loading too early'.
## What personal twist did you add?
I added a fun color background, follows rainbow-ish colors. I also added after 50 clicks there is raining cookies. I also did add a strech element through CSS animation to the milestone messages everytime they appear.
## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction? Honestly, I have a younger brother and some of these games are very popular in their middle school as its easy and you can play such games in class.  However, event listerns can be used for real time events such as famous apps like Duolingo where it needs to listen to user interactions and give feedback in real time.
